          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>Computer Vision, Machine Learning
          <p>Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that "gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly 
              programmed" (Arthur Samuel, 1959).<p> Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in 
               artificial intelligence, machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make
              predictions on data â€“ such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data driven predictions
               or decisions, through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where 
              designing and programming explicit algorithms is infeasible; example applications include spam filtering, detection of network 
             intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach, optical character recognition (OCR), search engines and
              computer vision.</p>

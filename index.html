	   <h3>Course Design</h3>
		 <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tetris Game; C++ </span> <br>
                I began with shape management. I created a four-dimensional array of 7x4x4x4 to store the 7 possible shapes, 
		each with 4 possible rotations, on a 4Ã—4 grid which is essentially the bounding box for each shape. 
		I created a class TetrisShape for this.<br>
                Then, I dealt with piece movement and edge collisions. To make the pieces move I updated them and moved them down one row each time a fixed time interval expires. 
	        In real Tetris, this interval is based on what level of the game you are on, and that is exactly what we do here. 
		So first I've introduced a Level variable. And I made a place to store the contents of the bucket (game board),
		so when a piece reaches the bottom it won't  vanish. <br>
                Collision detection was the next thing I need to handle with. I was a bit cheeky and just disallowed rotation if it collided with another piece on the board;
		in reality the piece might get shifted a little bit but this is for all intents and purposes an unusual edge case scenario, 
		and real Tetris also disallows the majority of such rotations. Next up I detected when lines have been filled, removed them, 
		kept and displayed score, and handled the situation where the grid gets full. Finally, scores, level, line clearing,
		grid moving when line is cleared, and bonus scores for multiple lines added. 
			 
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cluster sky objects; Python</span> <br>
		Cluster a catalog of 2 million sky objects into similar objects, e.g., galaxies, nearby stars, quasars, etc. These sky objects have 7 features. 
		Use Euclidean cluster algorithm. Each cluster has a well defined centroid. <br>
		Assumes Euclidean space and start by picking k, the number of clusters. Initialize clusters by picking one point per cluster. Then for each point, 
		place it in the cluster whose current centroid is the nearest, and update the centroid of the cluster. After all points are assigned,
		fix the centroids of the k clusters. 
		Reassign all points to their closest centroid. (Sometimes moves points between clusters.)	 
			 
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Student Information Management System; C </span> <br>
                The system is developed based on linked list.
                It can input student_number, name, coursecode, credithours, semester, final marks for each subject and is able use text file. 
                It calculates GPA for each student and is able to search a student by its name or GPA.
